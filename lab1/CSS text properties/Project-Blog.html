        <p>Something excited happened.</p>
        <p id="op">Once bitten by the b,ug, I found myself dreaming about creative ways to make a few bucks and get my next entrepreneurial fix. The shortlist of business schemes that were born out of the countless hours spent in less than stimulating classrooms still gives me a chuckle to this day. Snow removal, landscaping, raccoon trapping, marine wood restoration, tree trimming, and scads of other odd jobs didn't exactly build a resume for the Blue Chip corporate world, but they did provide the hard-knock lessons that really stoked my fire. Not surprisingly, it is the real world education I received tending these small-business ventures that I draw from to this day. I never did figure out what the heck the Pythagorean Theorem was all about, and thankfully, I can't seem to recall a time when I needed it as of late.

Each business that I have undertaken has presented new and greater challenges. The personal satisfaction I got ditching school to plow driveways gave me a sense of satisfaction that no test or reading assignment ever could. I got my plow stuck more than once, but I always managed to work things out. Though I bleached the name off the side of the boat on my first teak refinishing job, I made things right with the customer and went on to master the skills necessary to build a successful business. Many of the trees I tackled during my first days as a tree trimmer were way over my head, yet I overcame my fears and successfully completed every job I began.</p>
